* ## What does this project do?
This project is to create a personal blog webpage where you can post and attach photos. Through this project, you will be able to gain an overall knowledge of HTML. You will know that you can create a website, add songs and images through HTML. Additionally, you can practice using HTML, linking with Rasberry pi, and using website.


* ## Why is this project useful?
I think people no longer write their own diaries or writings in their notebooks, but use computers or cell phones to write them. Therefore, I thought people needed a personal blog website that everyone could use to fit the current era. You can upload pictures or write and save them anytime, anywhere. It also has an ID and password, so there is no inconvenience in using a personal blog. People interested in blogging will use the project.
